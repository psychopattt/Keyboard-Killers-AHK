# Keyboard-Killers-AHK
AutoHotKey achievements scripts for Keyboard Killers

## How To Use:

1. Install AutoHotKey: https://www.autohotkey.com/

2. Download and extract the scripts. Make sure you don't move or rename the "keypress_scripts" folder or any script in it.

3. Run "main.ahk". It won't press anything yet, it's paused by default.

4. Launch the game and launch the level "Music LvL" in the "Professional Levels" category.

5. Immediatly after starting the level, press "F2". This will start the main script which will launch all the keypress scripts, complete the level and restart, by itself, indefinitely.

6. IMPORTANT: To terminate the whole script, pres F1 MULTIPLE TIMES (about 5 or 10 to be sure). This will stop all keypresses and terminate the scripts. If you don't close all the scripts, they will continue to press keys while you are doing other things.


## Notes

1. If you have not started the main script fast enough, the level might fail. Simply terminate the script and redo steps 3-5.

2. This script also unlocks the "Kill 1111 meteors in 1 lvl" achievement.

3. The level takes about 1:36 to complete and destroys 1205 meteors. The script will need to run for about 2 hours and 13 minutes to destroy 100 000 meteors.

4. This script could be modified to achieve 100% by modifiying the timers, I just don't want to spend the time. It currently completes at 59%. You can modify the scripts yourself, but the code is pretty cursed, so good luck.
